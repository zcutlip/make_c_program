# make_c

A script to generate a simple C program with a few basic includes and a `main()`. Then it opens the file in your editor of choice placing the cursor at the proper line and column to start adding code.

Supported editors include:

- vim
- SublimeText (`subl`)
- TextMate (`mate`)

## Installing

```console
$ cd make_c
$ python3 setup.py install
```

Creating and editing a file:

```console
make_c foo.c

#Edit in SublimeText instead:

make_c foo.c --editor=subl

#Generate a makefile in addition to the C file.

make_c foo.c --generate-makefile
```

## Adding editor support

To add additional editors, extend the `CProgram` class and override:

- The `EDITOR` class variable
- The `DESCRIPTION` class variable
- The `generate_editor_command()` instance method

The string representation for `--list-editors` is automatically generated by the superclass from `EDITOR` and `DESCRIPTION`.

The `generate_editor_command()` method should return an `argv` that represents that editor's commandline incantation in list form suitable for consumption by `subprocess.Popen()`. For example, if your editor takes a `--line` and `--column` argument, you would return:

```python
def generate_editor_command(self):
    return [self.EDITOR,
            "--line",
            "%d" % self.edit_line,
            "--column",
            "%d" % self.edit_column,
            self.filename]
```
